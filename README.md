## How can I build a Recipe Skill for Alexa? <a id="intro"></a>

Breakfast Sandwich is a skill that will guide the user through the process to prepare and cook a meal.
The skill can give the user a list of recipe ingredients, and then guide them through all the recipe steps.
You can install the skill, and then update the text within the Lambda Javascript code to define your own Recipe and Ingredients.

### Installing the skill

At this point you should be familiar with the process of installing the skill and able to get through it on your own.  If not, feel free to review the [Detailed Instructions](https://github.com/voicehacks/Recipe/tree/master/Detailed%20Setup%20Instructions) for some step-by-step guidance. Otherwise, go ahead and install the skilland use the code provided in [src/index.js](src/index.js) then proceed to the [first lab](https://github.com/voicehacks/Recipe/tree/master/Lab%201). 

### Test

Practice speaking to the skill a few times to learn all the features of the skill.
When you ask for "ingredients", you will both hear a list of ingredients, and see the list on your Alexa app or Echo Show screen, if you have one.
When you ask to "begin cooking", the skill will guide you through each step in the process.
