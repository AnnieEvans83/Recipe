## How can I build a Recipe Skill for Alexa? <a id="intro"></a>
Have you ever called customer service and spent 10 minutes listening to menu options, choosing prompts, then repeating the process? What happens when you get disconnected and have to call back again? You start from the beginning, and have to trudge through the entire tree of options again. When we rely only on session data, the same thing will happen with Alexa. This lab will teach you how to use a database to persist information. This will lead to a more natural, conversational feel to your skill from a user's perspective.

This lesson consists of 3 main steps: Use the code provided in [src/index.js](src/index.js) and in [speechAssets/IntentSchema.json](speechAssets/IntentSchema.json)

### Task 1: Build the Skill

At this point you should be familiar with the process of installing the skill and able to get through it on your own.  If not, feel free to review the [detailed instructions](https://github.com/voicehacks/Recipe/tree/master/Detailed%20Setup%20Instructions) for some step-by-step guidance. Otherwise, go ahead and install the skill and use the code provided in [src/index.js](src/index.js) then proceed to the [first lab](https://github.com/voicehacks/Recipe/tree/master/Lab%201).

### Task 2: Enable Permissions

### Task 3: Enable Database

### Test

Practice speaking to the skill a few times to learn all the features of the skill.
When you ask for "ingredients", you will both hear a list of ingredients, and see the list on your Alexa app or Echo Show screen, if you have one.
When you ask to "begin cooking", the skill will guide you through each step in the process.
